# Capitalize Strings in a Functional Style in JS

This code capitalizes words, strings, and arrays of words and strings in a functional programming style using basic JavaScript. JavaScript has toLowerCase and toUpperCase, but no toCaptialized. This addresses that issue.

When I am solving a problem I almost always reach for a functional approach as to a more object oriented or a more procedural style. The reasons I do this has a lot to due with finding and fixing bugs over the years, and my desire to write _testable_ code, even if I am not going to write tests for it. Creating structure, ie mixing data and procedure, makes things more brittle and harder to test.

For me a mix of functional and object oriented is usually my favorite approach, and when the two constradict, instead of compliment each other, I side on the functional approach.

This repository contains the code that I based an episode of DevmentorLive on. You can find the episode at: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1A7BEX5SCo&t=1s)
